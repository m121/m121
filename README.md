# Hi, I'm Mateo Full Frontend developer here <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">


I am currently a Frontend Developer at Seeed, where I design and build modern ecommerce solutions using technologies such as Headless, TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Shopify. My focus is on delivering efficient, scalable interfaces that enhance user experience in digital products.

In parallel, I am working to transition my career toward integrating artificial intelligence into technology projects. I’m actively learning and experimenting with AI agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP), memory management, and intelligent workflows, leveraging frameworks such as Mastra.ai and Vercel AI SDK.

I am passionate about deeply exploring various design patterns for agent orchestration, different evaluation testing for AI agents(Evals) , and optimizing memory management in agents.

I am seeking professional opportunities focused exclusively on artificial intelligence, where I can grow as an AI developer or AI engineer and contribute to building robust agent workflows and orchestration patterns.
